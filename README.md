I'm a **pre-final year IT student** at **SSN College of Engineering**, passionate about **Software Development, Full-Stack Engineering, and AI/ML**. I love tackling challenges, building cool projects, and learning new tech.  

Outside of coding, I'm a **music enthusiast and guitarist**—jamming, experimenting with melodies, and exploring different genres keep me going. Always up for learning, creating, and pushing my limits! 🚀🎸
