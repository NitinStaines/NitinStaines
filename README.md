I'm a **pre-final year IT student** at **SSN College of Engineering**, passionate about **Software Development, Full-Stack Engineering, and AI/ML**. I love tackling challenges, building cool projects, and learning new tech.  

Outside of coding, I'm a **music enthusiast and guitarist**â€”jamming, experimenting with melodies, and exploring different genres keep me going. I'm also into **street photography**, capturing everyday moments, unique perspectives, and the beauty of urban life through my lens.  

Always up for **learning, creating, and pushing my limits!** ðŸš€ðŸŽ¸ðŸ“·
